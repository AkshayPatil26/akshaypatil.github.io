    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <h4>Hello, I’m Akshay Patil.</h4>
    <p>
      In 2017, I graduated from the New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT)
      with a M.S. in Computer Science.<br />
      I’ve been working as a Developer ever since. <br /><br />In the final
      semester at NJIT, I took a User Experience Design class. I felt an instant
      connection with the subject. <br />I aspire to use my technical knowledge
      of computers and thoughtfully build Human Centered Interfaces for digital
      devices and beyond. <br /><br />I am currently enrolled in Google’s UX
      Design Professional Certificate Course on Coursera. <br />My goal is to
      condition myself as a UX engineer in the coming months. <br />
